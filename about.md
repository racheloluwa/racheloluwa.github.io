<p style="text-align: justify;">I am a PhD researcher in Computer Science at the <a href="https://sit.uct.ac.za/hpi-members">Hasso Plattner Institute Research School</a> and <a href="https://sit.uct.ac.za/">Department of Computer Science, School of IT</a>, <a href="https://uct.ac.za/">University of Cape Town</a>, South Africa. My research focuses on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), where I leverage co-design and participatory approaches to develop inclusive, technology-driven ICT4D solutions for real-world challenges. My goal is to ensure that technology is accessible and beneficial to diverse communities. I conduct my research within the HCI Lab at the <a href="https://uct.ac.za/">University of Cape Town</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://www.melissadensmore.com/">Prof. Melissa Densmore</a>. I am a recipient of the <a href="https://sit.uct.ac.za/hpi-research-school">Hasso Plattner Institute Fellowship</a> and a University of Ibadan Scholar.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I hold a Master of Science (MSc) degree in <a href="https://sci.ui.edu.ng/compsciwelcome">Computer Science</a> from the <a href="http://www.ui.edu.ng/">University of Ibadan, Nigeria</a>, where I was supervised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_pxWbLIAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Olufade Falade Williams ONIFADE</a>. I was a University Scholar, fully funded by the University of Ibadan Student Affairs Office. I also earned a First-Class Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree from the <a href="http://www.ui.edu.ng/">University of Ibadan</a>, where my final-year project was supervised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=8kYIdEQAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate">Dr. AYORINDE Ibiyinka Temilola</a>. This degree earned me a full scholarship for my master’s program.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I am a faculty member at <a href="https://lasustech.edu.ng/">Lagos State University of Science and Technology, Lagos, Nigeria</a>, where I serve as a lecturer and researcher in the <a href="https://lasustech.edu.ng/department/3646b4bb-9cae-40a7-9c61-d5408906ca3e">Department of Computer Science</a>. I have taught several undergraduate computer science courses. Additionally, I am a Teaching Assistant at the <a href="https://uct.ac.za/">University of Cape Town</a>, where I supervise <a href="https://sit.uct.ac.za/masters-information-technology">Master of Information Technology (MIT)</a> courses under the course convenor, <a href="https://sit.uct.ac.za/nitschke-lab/nitschke-lab-people">Geoff Nitschke</a>. Previously, I was a Teaching Assistant at the <a href="https://sci.ui.edu.ng/compsciwelcome">Department of Computer Science, University of Ibadan</a>, where I tutored and assisted in laboratory sessions for various computer science courses.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As an early-career researcher, I am open to networking, collaboration, and fellowship opportunities—one of my key career goals for 2025. If you would like to get in touch, please feel free to send me an email.</p>
