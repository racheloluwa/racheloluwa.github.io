I am a PhD researcher in Computer Science at the Hasso Plattner Institute Research School, University of Cape Town, South Africa. My research focuses on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), where I leverage co-design and participatory approaches to develop inclusive, technology-driven ICT4D solutions for real-world challenges. My goal is to ensure that technology is accessible and beneficial to diverse communities. I conduct my research within the HCI Lab at the University of Cape Town under the supervision of Prof. Melissa Densmore. I am a recipient of the Hasso Plattner Institute Fellowship and a University of Ibadan Scholar.

I hold a Master of Science (MSc) degree in Computer Science from the University of Ibadan, Nigeria, where I was supervised by Prof. Onifade Olufade. I was a University Scholar, fully funded by the University of Ibadan Student Affairs Office. I also earned a First-Class Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree from the University of Ibadan, where my final-year project was supervised by Dr. Ayorinde. This degree earned me a full scholarship for my master’s program.

I am a faculty member at Lagos State University of Science and Technology, Lagos, Nigeria, where I serve as a lecturer and researcher in the Department of Computer Science. I have taught several undergraduate computer science courses. Additionally, I am a Teaching Assistant at the University of Cape Town, where I supervise Master of Information Technology (MIT) courses under the course convenor, Geoff Nitschke. Previously, I was a Teaching Assistant at the Department of Computer Science, University of Ibadan, where I tutored and assisted in laboratory sessions for various computer science courses.

As an early-career researcher, I am open to networking, collaboration, and fellowship opportunities—one of my key career goals for 2025. If you would like to get in touch, please feel free to send me an email.
