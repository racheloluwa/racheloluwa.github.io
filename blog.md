<h2>Do We Need a Bit of Technology for Societal Challenges?</h2>

<p>It's a question that sounds deceptively simple: Do we need a bit of technology for societal challenges? Not a total overhaul. Not a revolution. Just a bit. But even that “bit” is loaded with assumptions — about what technology is, what it does, and who gets to wield it.

<br>Some argue that the most pressing societal issues — poverty, inequality, injustice — are fundamentally human problems, rooted in systems, histories, and relationships. In this light, technology is merely a tool, often too blunt for the complexity it tries to shape. A database won’t dismantle bias. An app won’t redistribute power. A sensor won’t heal fractured communities.

<br>Yet, technology also holds a mirror to our ambitions. It allows us to model possibilities, amplify voices, and reach further than before. A “bit” of it — a well-timed text message, a simple digital platform, a data visualization — can sometimes shift conversations that have long been stuck. Technology doesn’t always need to be grand to be transformative. But is transformation always what’s needed?

<br>There’s also the question of whose problems are being solved — and whose technologies are being imposed. A solution developed in one part of the world may not translate meaningfully to another. What’s seen as innovation in one context may feel like intrusion in another. Even the “bit” of technology, when introduced without care, can become an anchor instead of a sail.

<br>Perhaps the deeper issue isn’t whether technology is needed, but whether we still trust ourselves to solve societal problems without defaulting to it. Are we seeking genuine solutions, or are we outsourcing our discomfort to machines?

<br>So the question lingers: Is a bit of technology the key to progress — or a distraction from more difficult, necessary conversations?</p>
