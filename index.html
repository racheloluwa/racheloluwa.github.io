<p style="text-align: justify;">Hello there, and welcome to my homepage!<br><br>My name is <b>Rachel Feyisayo Oluwatuyi</b>, and I am a PhD student at the <a href="https://www.uct.ac.za/">University of Cape Town</a>, South Africa. I am also a faculty member at the <a href="https://lasustech.edu.ng/">Lagos State University of of Science and Technology, Ikorodu, Lagos State</a>, Nigeira.<br><br>

As an early-career researcher and I maintain a list of my publications under the <a href="/research/">Research</a> tab. I am a dedicated lecturer with a strong track record of teaching across the various universities in which I have served. I continue to actively engage in teaching, and a selection of the courses I have delivered — and currently teach — is available under the <a href="/teaching">Teaching tab</a>. You may also check out my <a href="https://github.com/racheloluwa">Github profile.</a><br><br>

To get a better insight on my life so far, you can have a look at my <a href="/cv">curriculum vitae</a> and some of my life updates at <a href="/updates">Updates</a> tab. I blog (although quite less frequently) and pin them down <a href="/blog">here</a>. Feel free to read a bit more <a href="/about">about me</a>.</p>
